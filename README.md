I'm a embedded systems engeering passionate about problem-solving, improving developer tooling and experiences, audio programming, and open-source software. Recently I've been expanding my skills in Rust, embedded programming, and circuit board design. I also have a passion for server hardware and spend some of my free time maintaining my home server rack, networking, and modding server equipment.
